### Pattern Scaling
Pattern scaling is a technique used by climate scientist to create computationally inexpensive emulations of future climate under varying assumptions about future human emissions. This repo contains R code associated with the manuscript "Emulating Climate Extreme Indices" linked below. The code approximates 1.5C and 2.0C warming scenarios using NCAR-CESM model output from the RCP4.5 radiative forcing scenario.
